What is Anthill?
-----------------

Anthill Game Framework (Anthill) - is a small framework for creating great games on Flash Action Script 3. The framework is inspired by [Flixel](http://flixel.org/). Unfortunately, at the moment Anthill does not use the GPU for graphics render, and the main emphasis is put on the fast software render and convenience of creating games.

Key feature of the Anthill it's rasterization of vector graphics "on the fly", which offers high performance and small size of Flash games.
